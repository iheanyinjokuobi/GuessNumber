## Architecture

This application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:

- **Model**: Handles the game logic and state, including random number generation and guess validation.
- **View**: Manages the user interface, displaying prompts and feedback.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, processing user input and updating the view based on the model's state.
